Here's an email correspond that I (pmuellr) had with James Ernest:

    Date: Fri, 22 Feb 2013 16:15:24 -0800
    Subject: Re: web version of Timeline
    From: James Ernest <...@gmail.com>
    To: Patrick Mueller <...@gmail.com>

    Patrick:

    Thanks for your note.

    Yes, technically what you're talking about is a derivative product, for
    which you need special permission. But in this case, it just requires the
    extra step of asking me, and then I say yes. :)

    I know the odds may be small that your project gets done, but I wish you
    the best of luck and I'd like to help however I can. If you'd like the game
    artwork in a better format, or any other art to help dress it up, please
    let me know.

    Thanks for writing (and for donating) and I'll talk to you soon,

    -James
